/**
 * Pen — shared drawing surface for the weapon generators.
 * Extracted from IconGenerator — faithful TypeScript port of Brian MacIntosh's Icon Machine
 * procedural pixel-art weapon generator (blades, spears).
 *
 * The original also generates potions; that generator was dropped in this
 * build — only the weapon generators are ported.
 *
 * The original was a single `RandomArt` object bound to the page DOM. This
 * strips the UI: construct with a 2D canvas context + a square dimension, then
 * call `generate(config)`. Same seed + class → same icon on every device.
 *
 * The drawing math is kept 1:1 with the source (including its quirks) so output
 * matches the original pixel-for-pixel.
